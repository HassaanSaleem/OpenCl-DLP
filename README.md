# OpenCl-DLPAbstract:

The idea is to implement matrix and vector multiplication algorithm using OpenCL programming concept and explore Data level Parallelism.

This is a visual studio project and to run it you have to configure OpenCL.

It contain two different functions matrix-multiplication and vector-multiplication and both are executed on different GPUs.
One on Intel and other on AMD.
